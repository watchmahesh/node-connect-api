Without Cristiano Ronaldo in the final list for the first time since 2004, it was up to Manchester City’s Portuguese duo Bernardo Silva and Ruben Dias, who finished 39th in this year’s voting, to represent the national colors at the much-lauded ceremony. It was held on Monday at the Paris (France) exhibition. In the early hours of this Friday, the choices of the 100 journalists who participated in the voting were announced, and we can say that some of the choices are surprising, as is usual in all votes. Specifically in the case of Bernardo Silva, the Portuguese with the best position this year, know that there are 8 other countries, in addition to Portugal – whose responsibility lies with journalist Joaquim Reita (SIC) – that have placed the creative citizen among the top five footballers. In the world last season. All sounds can be seen in the images above. By log 1 Leave your comment “Food fanatic. Organizer. Hipster-friendly tv specialist. Avid reader.
