I have to admit that I actually think it's a pretty good game.\nThis game's real letdown is the sound which, to put it mildly, is duff.\nGRAPHICS: 86%\nSOUND: 40%\nGAMEPLAY: 90%\nOVERALL: 86%\nhttps://www.mobygames.com/game/1260 3/kick-off-96/\nThe Amiga version had a rather inexcusable bug, where the game rarely reached half-time - the first half simply continued infinitely, even after a goal was scored. Amiga Power magazine gave the game just 1% on account of this, noting that it only got any marks at all because the people stupid enough to buy it would have Â£20 less for food and clothing, thus leading to an increase in the world's average IQ.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":null,"categories":null,"external_links":null,"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"rating":null,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:11:46.877+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:11:46.877+02:00"}
