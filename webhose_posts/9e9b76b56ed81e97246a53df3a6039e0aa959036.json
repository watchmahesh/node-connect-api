The lobster tempura was great, cooked perfectly. The Alabama white BBQ sauce, requested to be on the side, was nothing special, mostly mayo. Seared scallops were perfectly cooked. The Mahi Mahi catch of the day was very good as well. The mango pudding: wonderful mango lillkoi sorbet, throw away the gelatinous pudding below it.\\nGreat service and a beautiful location. One more question: why is pop music playing in the background instead of some traditional hawaii or Polynesian music?","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":null,"categories":null,"external_links":null,"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"rating":5,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:11:59.622+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:11:59.622+02:00"}
