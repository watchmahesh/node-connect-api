This a small tapas (small plates) restaurants which is perfect for couples or small groups. The choice was mainly Spanish with some other Mediterranean items. The server was very helpful and advised on the number of plates for our group. Unlike the larger restaurants nearby it has a peaceful, friendly and relaxed ambience. The food was delicious and surprisingly good value compared to the nearby restaurants. Highly recommended.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":null,"categories":null,"external_links":null,"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"rating":5,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:07:44.782+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:07:44.782+02:00"}
