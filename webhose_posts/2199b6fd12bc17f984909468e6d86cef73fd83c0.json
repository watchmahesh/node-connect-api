The food was really good, just a little expensive for small-ish portions. The margherita pizza sauce was amazing, and they brought me fresh parmesan. The tiramisu was very good, and the restaurant also gave us complimentary chocolate espresso marshmallow truffles for our anniversary. The interior was gorgeous and the ambience was great. I would definitely recommend for a nice date night or occasion.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":null,"categories":null,"external_links":null,"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"rating":4,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:10:55.669+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:10:55.669+02:00"}
