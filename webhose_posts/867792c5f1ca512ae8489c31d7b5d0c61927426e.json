Bleach damages your hair by removing the natural oils and proteins that keep it healthy and strong, leaving it feeling dry, brittle, and prone to breakage. But don’t fret – there are ways to repair bleach damaged hair and restore it to its former glory. In this article, we will be discussing how to repair bleach damaged hair and sharing some tips on how to prevent further damage. So, let’s get started!\nPreventing further damage\nBefore we dive into repairing bleach damaged hair, it’s important to consider how we can prevent further damage. One of the most effective ways to prevent hair damage is by using a deep conditioning treatment on a regular basis. This will help to strengthen and nourish your hair, making it less prone to damage.\nUse a heat protectant\nOne of the main culprits of hair damage is heat styling. Whether it’s blow-drying, straightening or curling, applying heat to your hair can cause damage over time. To prevent this, it’s important to use a heat protectant spray or serum before styling your hair. This will help to minimize the damage caused by heat, leaving your hair looking and feeling healthier.\nAvoid over-washing your hair\nWashing your hair too often can also contribute to damage. This is because washing your hair strips it of its natural oils, which help to keep it healthy. To prevent damage, try to limit your hair washing to once or twice a week and use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo. This will help to keep your hair clean while also preventing it from becoming too dry.\nEat a healthy diet\nYour diet can also play a role in the health of your hair. Eating a diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help to nourish your hair from the inside out. Some key nutrients for healthy hair include biotin, vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids. Try to incorporate foods such as eggs, avocados, nuts and fatty fish into your diet to promote healthy hair.\nDeep Conditioning\nDeep conditioning is one of the best treatments for bleach damaged hair. When you bleach your hair, you strip it of its natural oils and moisture, and that leads to dull, brittle, and lifeless hair. Deep conditioning helps restore lost moisture in your hair and helps protect your hair from further damage.\nHow to deep condition your hair?\nYou should deep condition your hair once a week or more frequently if necessary for severely damaged hair. Apply a deep conditioner to your hair, working it through from roots to ends. Comb through your hair to ensure even coverage. Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap and leave the conditioner on for at least 30 minutes. Rinse the conditioner out with cool water. For best results, use a deep conditioner that contains natural oils, such as coconut oil, argan oil, tea tree oil, and olive oil.\nThe benefits of deep conditioning\nDeep conditioning can help nourish and strengthen your hair, increase elasticity, reduce frizz, and promote healthy hair growth. By adding a deep conditioning treatment to your hair care routine, you can improve the overall health and appearance of your hair.\nOlaplex Treatment\nIf you’re looking for a more intensive treatment for bleach-damaged hair, Olaplex is a great option. Olaplex is a three-step system that helps repair damaged hair and strengthens it from within. It works on a molecular level, repairing the broken bonds in your hair that have been damaged by bleach, heat, or chemical treatments.\nHow to do an Olaplex treatment?\nYou can do an Olaplex treatment both at home or at a salon. The three-step Olaplex system includes:\n|No||Step||Description|\n|1||No. 1 Bond Multiplier||The first step is applied to dry hair, and it helps rebuild the broken bonds in your hair.|\n|2||No. 2 Bond Perfector||The second step is applied over the No. 1 Bond Multiplier, and it helps further strengthen and protect your hair.|\n|3||No. 3 Hair Perfector||The third step is a take-home treatment that you can use once a week to maintain healthy, strong hair.|\nOlaplex treatment can be done before or after any chemical hair treatment, such as coloring, bleaching, or perming. It’s a great way to prevent further damage to your hair and keep it looking healthy and shiny.\nProtein Treatment\nProtein treatments can help repair bleach-damaged hair by strengthening the hair shaft. They infuse the hair with protein to help restore the natural elasticity of your hair, and can help reduce breakage and further damage.\nHow to do a protein treatment?\nYou can do a protein treatment at home or at a salon. There are many protein treatments available on the market, but here’s a simple recipe to make your own:\nMix together one egg, one tablespoon of coconut oil, and one tablespoon of honey. Apply the mixture to your hair, working it through from roots to ends. Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap and leave the treatment on for at least 30 minutes. Rinse the mixture out with cool water and wash your hair as usual.\nThe benefits of protein treatment\nProtein treatments can help strengthen your hair, reduce breakage, and improve the overall health and appearance of your hair. Be sure to follow up with a deep conditioning treatment after your protein treatment to restore lost moisture to your hair.\n|No||Important Information|\n|1||Determine the extent of the damage and whether it can be fixed at home or by a professional|\n|2||Switch to a gentle shampoo and conditioner specifically meant for damaged hair|\n|3||Deep condition hair regularly with a protein-rich treatment to help repair strands|\n|4||Limit the use of heating tools to avoid further damage|\n|5||Avoid harsh chemicals like hair dye or peroxide until the hair is fully healed|\n|6||Protect hair from the sun and harsh weather conditions with a scarf or hat|\n|7||Trim split ends regularly to promote healthy hair growth|\n|8||Consider using natural remedies like coconut oil, avocado, or egg yolks to nourish hair|\nUse a Deep Conditioner\nOne of the best things you can do for your bleach-damaged hair is to use a deep conditioner. Deep conditioners are designed to penetrate the hair shaft and provide intense moisture to your hair. This will help repair the damage that bleach has caused and strengthen your hair to prevent future damage.\nHow to Use a Deep Conditioner\nWhen using a deep conditioner, it is important to follow the instructions on the product. Generally speaking, you should start by shampooing your hair and then applying the conditioner. Leave the conditioner on for 10-15 minutes, or as directed on the product label. Rinse the conditioner out thoroughly with cool water to seal the cuticle and lock in moisture.\nThe Best Deep Conditioners for Bleach Damaged Hair\nWhen looking for a deep conditioner, you want to find one that is specifically formulated for damaged hair. Look for ingredients like keratin, argan oil, and coconut oil.

Hair masks strengthen, moisturize and repair the hair shaft, and keep the hair hydrated. As a result, the hair is less prone to breakage and hair fall, giving ultimate shine and smoothness to your hair.\nHow to Repair Bleach Damaged Hair with Hair Masks\nWhile purchasing a hair mask, look for masks that contain nourishing ingredients such as argan oil, coconut oil, shea butter, and natural proteins like keratin, which help in repairing hair from within. You can also prepare hair masks at home using coconut milk, honey, avocado, and eggs, which will give you a salon-like treatment from the comfort of your own home. Here’s how to use hair masks on bleach damaged hair:\n- Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo that suits your hair type.\n- Apply the hair mask evenly from the roots to the ends of your hair.\n- Let the hair mask sit for 20-30 minutes.

Moreover, avoid overusing hair masks as it may make your hair greasy and weigh them down, especially if you have thin hair.\nUse Hair Masks Regularly\nUsing hair masks regularly can help repair bleach damaged hair by providing deep conditioning and nourishing for the hair strands.\nChoose the Right Hair Mask\nWhen choosing a hair mask to use, it is important to consider the ingredients and their benefit for damaged hair.

Masks that contain protein such as keratin, hydrolyzed wheat protein, and silk amino acids can also help to rebuild the hair structure and strengthen the hair strands.\nApply Hair Mask Correctly\nWhen applying a hair mask, it is important to distribute it evenly through the hair, focusing on the ends. Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle the hair and ensure the mask is evenly distributed. Leave the mask on for at least 30 minutes before rinsing it off with cool water. Avoid using hot water, as it can strip the hair of its natural oils, which can lead to further damage.\nFrequency of Use\nThe frequency of using a hair mask depends on the severity of the hair damage. For mild damage, use a hair mask once a week. For moderate to severe damage, use a hair mask twice a week. Overusing hair masks can cause buildup and weigh the hair down, so it is important to find the right balance.\nUse Hair Masks for Deep Conditioning\nOne way to repair bleach damaged hair is by using hair masks that deep condition the tresses. The masks can help to restore the proteins, hydration, and nutrients lost during the bleaching process. Hair masks contain rich ingredients, including proteins, vitamins, and moisturizers, that penetrate the hair follicles to repair damaged strands.\nChoose a Hair Mask Suitable for Your Hair Type\nIt is important to choose a hair mask that is suitable for your hair type. For instance, if you have fine hair, you can use a lightweight hair mask that will not weigh down your hair. On the other hand, if you have thick or coarse hair, you can use a richer and more moisturizing mask. Ensure that the hair mask is formulated specifically for damaged, bleached, or color-treated hair.\nApply Hair Mask Regularly\nApply the hair mask regularly after shampooing and conditioning your hair. The frequency of application depends on your hair type and the level of damage. You can apply the hair mask once a week or every two weeks, depending on the hair’s needs.

It is the best option to start over and get rid of the frizzy and brittle strands. Cutting your hair does not necessary mean you have to shave your head bald, it can be just a few inches off the bottom to get rid of the damaged ends.\nTrimming your hair at home\nif you want to trim your hair at home, Make sure to work with sharp hair cutting scissors and section your hair to make it easier.
