Of course it is. Here are some suggestions that you can use immediately to stay healthy and beautiful for the upcoming Diwali holidays and other celebrations. There are many non-surgical beautification techniques including full body laser, medifacials, Hollywood facials, chemical peels and polishing of the body, arms, back and legs. Due to changing lifestyles, the demand for cosmetic procedures around Karwachauth and Diwali has changed significantly. A woman’s glowing, healthy skin is one of her most coveted attributes. “Every year during this time, it is mainly women in their 30s and early 40s who come to me for skin rejuvenation, especially during festivities like Diwali,” said Dr Jatin Mittal, Cosmetologist and Skin Expert from Abhivrit Aesthetics, New Delhi. Women are demanding complexion-enhancing procedures like chemical peels, carbon laser facials, Hollywood facials and skin polishing, according to Dr Jatin Mittal, as they are good for pigmentation, acne and other facial blemishes. Below are some tips suggested by Dr. Jatin Mittal for skin care and overall glow: 1. Look for your body’s cues and commit to always eating in response to your internal hunger cues. When you need festival treats and they look good, you might find yourself eating more even though you’re already full. But after that, think about your goal and how you will feel afterwards, and decide to refuse. Learn to express your gratitude verbally. 2. Never leave the house on an empty stomach or when hungry. An apple or other small portion of food will fill you up and keep you from feeling hungry. Nowadays, it is best to always have a small snack before going to a venue or party. Yogurt, cottage cheese, and homemade trail mix with raw sunflower and pumpkin seeds, dried cherries, raisins, dark chocolate chips, and more. 3. Eat your Joy Foods: Try to eat things you really like. Never consume something you don’t enjoy. 4. Always find opportunities to move: If a formal workout program doesn’t work for you, skip it and get moving, even a 10-minute walk in your pencil heels in the morning or during the day counts. Instead of making excuses, turn them into tactics that will help you. Connect with family and friends, move, play and have fun. 5. Stay hydrated: No matter what, and even if you are extremely busy, always stay hydrated. Keep your fluid intake high by drinking water throughout the day. You can avoid the headaches and weariness you might typically experience at festivals by going there hydrated. Plus, water will keep your skin nourished and glowing. 6. Remember the CMS rule: Sunscreen, moisturizing and cleansing are essential. It will help preserve the well-being of your skin. Before going to bed, remember to remove your makeup and exfoliate your skin once a week. 7. Use only natural products: Natural products should always be used as they are healthy for your skin and have few side effects. In addition to starting a vitamin C diet, you can use natural vitamin C products on your face. Use a strawberry/orange peel face mask, for example, to gently exfoliate your skin and rid it of debris and dead cells that may have accumulated in your pores over time. 8. Try creating your packs: After washing your skin, apply fresh lemon and tomato juice. After waiting ten to fifteen minutes, rinse it off. Lemons contain citric acid, which can change the pH of the skin. Additionally, you can use tomato juice as it contains cooling liquids that soothe the skin, absorb excess oil from the face and give you an instant glow. 9. Photo facials for instant glow: Facial photos are very effective in treating fine lines, especially those around the lips and eyes. This method works exceptionally well to minimize persistent facial redness and the appearance of enlarged pores and dark circles under the eyes. Try them throughout the holiday season to surprise everyone with your instant glow.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":"neutral","categories":["Arts, Culture, and Entertainment","Health","Lifestyle and Leisure"],"external_links":[],"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"jatin mittal","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"jatin m","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[],"locations":[{"name":"hollywood","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"diwali","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"karwachauth","sentiment":"none"}]},"rating":null,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:11:09.826+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:11:09.826+02:00"}
