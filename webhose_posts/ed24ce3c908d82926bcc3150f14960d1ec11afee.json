It is; a war that's been going on since before Israel existed, when it was an idea. The objective of the War hasn't changed at all since the seeds of current day Israel started.\nAs for Israel giving Gaza autonomy? When? Cause if they did, it was so hush, hush, no one knew about it, not even the Gazans.\nIsrael controlled everything that went into Gaza (mostly; the important stuff anyway like food, medicine, electricity...), they controlled who could go in, who could leave.\nThat's not autonomy, or are you saying that prisoners are autonomous? Click to expand... I'm not going to quibble over what band of self-governance falls under the label \"autonomy,\" but there's a reason the government of Gaza is violently anti-Israel. If the provincial government of Saskatchewan declared itself dedicated to the destruction of Canada, and attacked Manitoba, Alberta, and Ottawa with military-level force, what do you think the response would be?\nI'm not sure how it worked in Canada, but in the U.S. we have a long history of wiping out people who violently resist invasion and occupation.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":null,"categories":null,"external_links":null,"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"rating":null,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:11:35.340+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:11:35.340+02:00"}
