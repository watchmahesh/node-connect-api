THE\nshy away, a white cheese from Iceland, is the new star of dairy products. All brands have seized on the phenomenon, from the traditional Danone or Yoplait to private label brands. Like good old yogurt, skyr comes in fruit, vanilla, low-fat or honey versions, always with the same promise: rich in protein and low in fat, it is excellent for your health.\nThe consumer association\nUFC-What to choose decided to explore this Icelandic white cheese, beyond the marketing veneer and its outrageous promises. In a note entitled “Skyr, an Icelandic scam?“, the association begins by noting that the prices of this dairy product “reach new heights“, specifying for example that it sells “around €9 per kilo for the Monoprix Gourmet and Siggi’s brands, or between 3 and 6 times more expensive than low-fat white cheese».\nThe myth of the “appetite suppressant effect”\nA pricing policy which questions to the extent that, continue the authors, “the skyr recipe looks exactly like that of industrial yogurt, except for its longer draining time“. However, it stands out for its higher protein intake than its neighbors in the fresh section: “on average 30 % more than low-fat white cheese», Specifies UFC-Que Choisir. In support of several experts, notably from the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE), the consumer association affirms that this surplus of proteins “is probably irrelevant to most of us», to the extent that the diet of the French, even vegetarians, is already very protein-rich.\nNote that this greater protein intake may prove beneficial for those over 60. “From the age of sixty, we sometimes lack protein, which promotes muscle wasting and increases the risk of loss of autonomy with age. A few grams more per serving are, in this case, always good to take», Explains a researcher cited by UFC-Que Choisir.\nThe specialists interviewed by the consumer association also put the alleged “appetite suppressant effect” protein products, regularly praised on the Internet. They explain that nothing has happened so far.clearly demonstrated» on this subject and that satiety was in any case only observed beyond a significant weight of protein which the Icelandic preparation is far from reaching.\n1699095992\n#Skyr #Icelandic #yogurt #star #fresh #section #good #\nhealth","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":"negative","categories":["Health"],"external_links":["https://madame.lefigaro.fr/art-de-vivre/skyr-yaourt-qui-cartonne-new-york-180714-898919","http://madame.lefigaro.fr/beaute/make-up-soins/cette-creme-a-l-acide-hyaluronique-a-2-99-euros-sort-du-lot-selon-l-ufc-que-choisir-20231011","https://www.madame.lefigaro.fr/art-de-vivre/skyr-yaourt-qui-cartonne-new-york-180714-898919","http://www.madame.lefigaro.fr/beaute/make-up-soins/cette-creme-a-l-acide-hyaluronique-a-2-99-euros-sort-du-lot-selon-l-ufc-que-choisir-20231011"],"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"siggi","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"ufc-que choisir","sentiment":"negative"},{"name":"ufc","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"iceland","sentiment":"none"}]},"rating":null,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:11:32.113+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:11:32.113+02:00"}
