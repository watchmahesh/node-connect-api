Among them, Vice President Dr.\n[Mahamudu Bawumia](/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=1188) is considered a frontrunner while Kennedy Ohene Agyapong, the Member of Parliament for Assin Central, is expected to be a strong competitor, particularly after his surprising second-place finish in the party's Super Delegates Conference, which took place in August.\nThe rest are former Food and Agric Minister, Dr. Owusu Akoto Afriyie, and former Member of Parliament, Francis Addai-Nimoh.\nWatch Bugri Naabu’s comments below\nBawumia will win by 95% - Chief Bugri Nabu, National Council Member & Former Northern Regional Chairman - NPP.— Serwaa Amihere (@Serwaa_Amihere)\n[#ElectionHub] [pic.twitter.com/O66Kv76M3h] [November 4, 2023]","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":"positive","categories":["Politics"],"external_links":[],"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[{"name":"bawumia","sentiment":"negative"},{"name":"bugri naabu","sentiment":"none"}],"organizations":[{"name":"npp","sentiment":"negative"},{"name":"new patriotic party","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"northern regional","sentiment":"none"}],"locations":[{"name":"ghana","sentiment":"none"},{"name":"bawumia","sentiment":"none"}]},"rating":null,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:11:38.360+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:11:38.360+02:00"}
