Have you ever wondered how to clean cast iron? Cast iron cookware is durable, versatile, and known for its ability to transfer heat evenly. However, cleaning it can be a bit overwhelming for some people. The good news is that with the right technique, cleaning cast iron can be a breeze. In this article, we will go over some easy steps to help you clean your cast iron cookware and keep it in great shape for years to come. So, let’s get started!\nThe Basics of Cleaning Cast Iron\nCast iron cookware is known for its durability and versatility, but it requires proper maintenance to ensure its longevity. Here are the basics of cleaning cast iron:\n1. Cleaning After Use\nThe most important thing to remember when cleaning cast iron is to never use soap or abrasive cleaners, as they can strip the seasoning and damage the surface of the cookware. Instead, simply wipe the pan with a clean, dry paper towel or cloth while it is still warm. If there is stubborn food residue, pour some coarse salt onto the pan and scrub gently with a paper towel or a non-abrasive brush.\n2. Maintaining the Seasoning\nThe seasoning on a cast iron pan is what gives it its non-stick surface and protects it from rust. To maintain the seasoning, never allow the pan to soak in water and always dry it thoroughly before storing. If the seasoning starts to wear off or the pan starts to rust, you can re-season it by rubbing a thin layer of oil all over the pan and then baking it in the oven for an hour.\n3. Storing Cast Iron\nWhen storing cast iron, it’s important to stack the pots and pans in a way that doesn’t scratch the seasoning. You can also place a paper towel or cloth in between each pan to protect the seasoning. Store the pans in a cool, dry place to prevent rust.\nDeep Cleaning Cast Iron\nWhile basic cleaning is enough for most everyday use, you may occasionally need to give your cast iron a deep cleaning to remove rust and build-up. Here’s how:\n1. Removing Rust\nIf your cast iron has rust, you can remove it by scrubbing the pan with a mixture of coarse salt and oil using a non-abrasive brush. Rinse the pan with hot water and dry it completely. You can also remove rust by soaking the pan in a 50/50 mixture of water and white vinegar for a few hours, then scrubbing with steel wool and rinsing.\n2. Removing Build-Up\nIf your cast iron has build-up from cooking, you can remove it by heating the pan on the stove, adding a few tablespoons of oil and a handful of coarse salt, and scrubbing the pan with a non-abrasive brush. Rinse the pan with hot water and dry it completely.\n3. Re-Seasoning After Deep Cleaning\nIf you do a deep cleaning on your cast iron, it’s important to re-season it to restore the non-stick surface and protect it from rust. Follow the seasoning process described in the first section of this article.\nCaring for Enameled Cast Iron\nEnameled cast iron requires different care than traditional cast iron, as the porcelain coating can chip and scratch if not handled properly. Here’s how to care for enameled cast iron:\n1. Cleaning After Use\nEnameled cast iron can be washed with soap and water, but avoid using abrasive cleaners and scrubbers that can damage the finish. You can also soak the pan if necessary, but don’t leave it in water for an extended period of time.\n2. Removing Stains\nIf your enameled cast iron has stains or discoloration, you can remove them by mixing baking soda and water into a paste and scrubbing the pan with a non-abrasive brush. Rinse the pan with hot water and dry it completely.\n3. Storing Enameled Cast Iron\nWhen storing enameled cast iron, avoid stacking the pots and pans to prevent chipping. You can use soft liners or protectors between each piece or store them individually.\nSeasoning Cast Iron\nOnce your cast iron is clean and dry, the next step is to properly season it. This is where you add a layer of oil or fat to your cast iron to help create a non-stick surface and protect it against rust.
