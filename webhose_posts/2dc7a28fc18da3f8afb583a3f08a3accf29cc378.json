Israel gets attacked, they lash back. You may see this as a war with pauses, I disagree. Basically, Israel gets attacked, they kick the asses off their attackers, then go home (or occupy, or occupy then go home). The next attack is a fresh act of war. Israel had given Gaza autonomy. Gaza used that autonomy to attack Israel. That has a price. Click to expand...\nIsrael gets attacked, they attack back.\nAnd then there's times where Israel attacks (or does stupid shit to instigate knowing what the response will be), Hamas or other terrorist groups attack back (or citizens who don't have access to the weapons the terrorists do) and then it's a fight again.\nI don't agree that this isn't all part of one war. It is; a war that's been going on since before Israel existed, when it was an idea. The objective of the War hasn't changed at all since the seeds of current day Israel started.\nAs for Israel giving Gaza autonomy? When? Cause if they did, it was so hush, hush, no one knew about it, not even the Gazans.\nIsrael controlled everything that went into Gaza (mostly; the important stuff anyway like food, medicine, electricity...), they controlled who could go in, who could leave.\nThat's not autonomy, or are you saying that prisoners are autonomous?","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":null,"categories":null,"external_links":null,"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"rating":null,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:11:35.309+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:11:35.309+02:00"}
