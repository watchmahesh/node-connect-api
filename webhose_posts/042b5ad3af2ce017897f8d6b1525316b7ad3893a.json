If making homemade gulab jamuns, follow your preferred recipe or use a ready-made mix. Shape the dough into small balls and deep-fry them in ghee or oil until they are golden brown. Drain and set aside.\nPrepare the sugar syrup for the gulab jamun. In a separate pan, combine the sugar and water, add crushed cardamom pods, saffron strands (if using), and rose water. Simmer for about 10 minutes until it forms a slightly thick syrup. Remove from heat and let it cool.\nOnce the fried gulab jamuns have cooled slightly, gently immerse them in the sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes.\nCrush the digestive biscuits or graham crackers into fine crumbs. You can use a food processor or place them in a ziplock bag and crush them with a rolling pin.\nCombine the crumbs with the melted butter, mixing until the crumbs are evenly coated.\nPress this mixture into the base of a 9-inch springform pan, creating an even layer. Place the pan in the refrigerator to set it while you prepare the filling.\nIn a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth and creamy.\nAdd the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.\nStir in the vanilla extract, sour cream, and all-purpose flour. Mix until the batter is smooth.\nAssembling the Cheesecake:\nPreheat your oven to 325 degree F (160 degree C).\nRemove the springform pan from the refrigerator and arrange the soaked gulab jamuns on top of the biscuit base.\nPour the cheesecake filling over the gulab jamuns, ensuring it's evenly distributed.\nBake the cheesecake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes or until the edges are set, but the center still has a slight jiggle.\nFor the Gulab Jamun Topping:\nWhile the cheesecake is cooling, you can reduce the remaining sugar syrup from the gulab jamuns to a thicker consistency.\nOnce the cheesecake has cooled to room temperature, refrigerate it for at least 4 hours or overnight.\nBefore serving, pour the thickened sugar syrup over the cheesecake.\nSlice, serve, and enjoy your delectable Gulab Jamun Cheesecake!\nDisclaimer:\nPlease write your correct name and email address.
