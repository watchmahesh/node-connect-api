Admittedly, it has been at least a decade since the last visit, but this time was surprisingly meh. The food was overly salty to the point where some dishes were unedible. The service was non-existent, and uninformed of the menu. And there was a wedding party that consumed the bar area for a period of time and ut was so loud you couldn't hear yourself let alone others. I am hoping this was just an off night and not the new norm, but I won't risk it any time soon again.","highlightText":"","highlightTitle":"","highlightThreadTitle":"","language":"english","sentiment":null,"categories":null,"external_links":null,"external_images":[],"entities":{"persons":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[]},"rating":3,"crawled":"2023-11-04T13:11:10.852+02:00","updated":"2023-11-04T13:11:10.852+02:00"}
